# This Project is a template for creating web projects.

# The dist folder is for the preprocessed css file gotten from the sass compilation (sass --watch app/scss:dist)

# The vendors-extensions sass partial folder is for your library files override, you don't have to have it if you don't need it.

# Remember, it's a template, you can modify it to fit your project

# At this point at which the project is, it demands a very strict sass abstract components naming (variables, mixins and so on)

# This is as a result of the use declarative being \* (global) so it is crucial that you dont have any multiple namings of the same name.

# Since there is no namespace functionality available, you would have to have a special naming convention that would prevent muitiple naming comflict
